This package can be used in Laravel 5.8 or higher.

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
```

The service provider will automatically get registered. Or you may manually add the service provider in your `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You must publish [the migration](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/blob/master/database/migrations/create_permission_tables.php.stub) with:

```bash
php artisan permission:migration
```

If you're using UUIDs or GUIDs for your `User` models you can update the `create_permission_tables.php` migration and replace `$table->unsignedBigInteger($columnNames['model_morph_key'])` with `$table->uuid($columnNames['model_morph_key'])`.
For consistency, you can also update the package configuration file to use the `model_uuid` column name instead of the default `model_id` column.

After the migration has been published you can create the role- and permission-tables by running the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan permission:config
```

When published, [the `config/permission.php` config file](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/blob/master/config/permission.php) initially contains:

```php
